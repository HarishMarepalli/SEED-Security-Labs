/*
After the gdb debugging step, we obtained the final shellcode. Towards the end, we included the "/bin/sh" command, which will initiate the shell once executed. To overwrite the return address, we utilize the "strcpy" function to copy our large_string containing the shellcode into the buffer. As a test, we incorporated a printf statement with the message "Testing" to verify if the new shell starts functioning. If the attack is successful, the shell will commence immediately after the printf statement.
